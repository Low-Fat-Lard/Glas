If there is one thing that you should learn when staring to learn Irish is the copula. 
It is used to describe a persons characteristics in Irish.
This means that the word order would be  **noun** + **adjective** + **subject**
When you construct a copula sentence, you need to remember these three things. The copula,  **IS**, the  **object**, and the **subject**, which is often a pronoun.
E.g. **Is**(Particle) **duine falsa mé** (subject) 
Which translates to  *I am a lazy person*
