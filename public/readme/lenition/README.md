Masculine words (usually words ending in broad vowels, or professions for example an post, an feirmeoir)

- When putting 'the' in front of a masculine word beginning with a consonant, there is no change to the word, for example, an madra.

- When putting 'the' in front of a masculine word beginning with a vowel, a t- is put in front, for example, an t-úrlár.

- When describing a masculine word, there is no change to the adjective, for example, an fear bocht.

- When writing the tiseal ginideach of a masculine word, you write the noun, then an, and the second noun with a h and in most cases a slightly different spelling, for example oifig an phoist.

NOTE - there is no need to write "an oifig an phoist" as the 'the' is already there before "phoist".

NOTE - certain words do not change in the TG like 'bus' (lána bus).

NOTE - certain phrases do not have the "the" in the middle of the phrase, such as "cúirt leadóige".

Feminine words (usually words ending in slender vowels, and words ending in "-e/ach", "e/acht" etc, eg an fhírinne, an bháisteach)

- When putting 'the' in front of a feminine word beginning with a consonant, a h is added after the first letter, for example, an chistin.

- When putting 'the' in front of a feminine word beginning with a vowel, there is no change to the word, for example, an óige.

- When putting 'the' in front of a feminine word beginning with s, a t is added to the beginning of the word, for example, an tsaotharlann.

- When describing a feminine word, a h is added after the first letter of the adjective, for example, an chathair mhór.

- When writing the tiseal ginideach of a feminine word, you write the noun, then na, and the second noun with, in most cases, a slightly different spelling, for example stádas na mná.

NOTE - certain words do not change in the TG like 'Gaeilge' (seachtain na Gaeilge).

NOTE - certain phrases do not have the "the" in the middle of the phrase, such as "mála scoile".

The most common exceptions to these rules are words beginning with any of the DNTLS. If two DNTLS come directly next to each other in a sentence, eg an bhean deas, there is no h added to the second word.
