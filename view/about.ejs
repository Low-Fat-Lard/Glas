            Welcome to glas! Glas is an interactive irish learning website. <br>If you click on an article, the
            description for each Irish rule will come up. At the end of the article, a link to the test of that article
            should be there. If you have anything you want to change about the website, just create an issue or a fork
            to
          the GitHub repo. I will make sure to see it. Made by <a href='https://github.com/Low-Fat-Lard'>Low-Fat-Lard</a>
