## About
Glas was a very poor attemt to fix the bad sides of Duoligo. It gives you a detailed description of the topic. One of the things that I didn't like about the Duolingo system was the way it didn't show how you got your question wrong, so I tried my best so the experience feels like reading a book. Having said that, it's VERY bad. I guess it was too ambitious for a teenager to tackle on a multi-billion dollar co-operation. It's still open source if you want it, though. I'm thinking about paying repl so it doesn't take hours for the page to load. [Link to Website](https://glas.low-fat-lard.repl.co)
## Main Features
### Users
- The users are saved in a JSON file, using the Node Passport plugin. The password gets encoded, so it should be fine security wise. 
### Achievements 
- Achievements are saved onto `LocalStorage`, where they are put into JSON format. They are all names of Albums I like. Give them a listen!
### Posts
- A clean blog system with it's own programming language, similar to markdown.
### Tests
- Tests pull a random quiz type, at the moment "muti-choice" and "text-input"
### Realitively Good CSS
- I know nothing about front-end. I tried my best to make it responsive.
### Games
- You can play hangman and a colour matching game. Will add more.
