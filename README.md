Glas - An ineractive Irish learning website
## Main Features
Users
- The users are saved in a JSON file, using the Node Passport plugin. The password gets encoded, so it should be fine security wise. 
Achievements 
- Achievements are saved onto `LocalStorage`, where they are put into JSON format. They are all names of Albums I like. Give them a listen!
Posts
- A clean blog system with it's own programming language, similar to markdown.
Tests
- Tests pull a random quiz type, at the moment "muti-choice" and "text-input"
Games
- You can play hangman and a colour matching game. Will add more.
